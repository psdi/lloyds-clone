# Lloyd's of London Clone

## Overview

This project serves as a clone of [this website](https://www.lloyds.com/news-and-risk-insight/risk-reports/library/technology/taking-control) as a requirement for the Chingu Voyage 10 Pre-work.

**Disclaimer**: I do not take credit for the layout, as the design is not original but rather only a clone. The images used are also not my property; credit goes once again to Lloyd's. However, I claim that I wrote my own code basing it off the site design without looking into the actual source code.

**Live Link:** https://psdi.github.io/lloyds-of-london-clone/
